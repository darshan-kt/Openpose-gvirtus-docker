### GVirtuS + OpenPose in Docker (with GUI Support)

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up a Dockerized environment for running OpenPose with GVirtuS, utilizing GPU acceleration and GUI output through X11 forwarding.

It is divided into two parts:

  1. Running OpenPose in Docker with real-time video streaming

  2. Integration of simple openpose application with GVirtuS


## 1.Running OpenPose in Docker with real-time video streaming
OpenPose is a real-time multi-person keypoint detection library developed by CMU. It estimates human body, face, hands, and foot poses from images or video using deep learning. Built on Caffe, it supports GPU acceleration and offers Python/C++ APIs for integration in research, applications, or real-time systems.

### Docker Run Command
To launch the container with all required permissions and capabilities:
```bash
docker run -it --name openpose_gvirtus_env \
  --network=host \
  --privileged \
  --gpus all \
  --env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  --env QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 \
  --volume /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
  --volume /dev:/dev \
  openpose-gvirtus-image
```
    âœ… Important: -it
    âž¤ Interactive terminal (run with keyboard input and output)
    
    --name openpose_gvirtus_env
    âž¤ Sets the container name to openpose_gvirtus_env
    
    --network=host
    âž¤ Shares the host's network (useful for streaming, real-time apps)
    
    --privileged
    âž¤ Grants full device access (e.g., /dev, USB, webcam)
    
    --gpus all
    âž¤ Enables access to all NVIDIA GPUs
    
    --env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY
    âž¤ Allows GUI apps in the container to display on the host
    
    --env QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1
    âž¤ Prevents Qt GUI display issues with shared memory
    
    --volume /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw
    âž¤ Mounts X11 socket for GUI display forwarding
    
    --volume /dev:/dev
    âž¤ Gives access to host hardware devices (e.g., camera, USB)
    
    openpose-gvirtus-image
    âž¤ Docker image to run (replace with your actual image name)
    
### Enable GUI Access from Docker
To allow the Docker container to access your X server:
```bash
xhost +local:root
```
This grants GUI display access for the container to your hostâ€™s X server.

### Enter the Docker Container
Once the container is running:
```bash
docker exec -it openpose_gvirtus_env bash
```

### Running OpenPose on a Video
Before running OpenPose, disable MIT-SHM if using GUI in Docker:
```bash
export MIT_SHM_DISABLE=1
./build/examples/openpose/openpose.binS
```

### Common Issue & Fix

If you encounter shared memory errors (MIT-SHM related), see this OpenPose GitHub issue for the solution:

##  2. Integration of simple openpose application with GVirtuS
GVirtuS (GPGPU Virtualization Service) is a framework that enables GPU acceleration in virtualized or containerized environments. It allows non-GPU hosts (like lightweight containers or remote clients) to offload GPU computations to a remote machine with a physical GPU. GVirtuS supports CUDA and works with libraries like cuDNN, making GPU-accelerated applications (e.g., OpenPose) usable in constrained environments.
